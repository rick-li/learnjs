            "summary": "CitiFX London Update CitiFX \u0026 Local Markets Strategy citifx.strategy@citi.com  ·       EUR: trading the ECB ·       Why AUD can’t sell-off post RBA ·       Tankan a modest JPY negative ·       CitiFX Global Flows: JPY selling gains momentum, EUR oversold, Latam and CEEMEA reversal ·       How much of a “strong USD” is already priced in? ·       European trip notes -- EUR bearishness, JPY complacency, Ukraine contained, China pessimism EUR: trading the ECB Ahead of the ECB we think that we could get a dovish statement and comments that focus on euro\u0027s recent strength; stronger forward guidance and measures that could fuel expectations of more unconventional policies like the suspension of SMP sterilization and a FLS scheme. With markets taking euro shorts off the table, EUR could come off again in the wake of the ECB. EURUSD could correct lower still in the run-up to NFP. Unchanged ECB (not our central case) could lead to further short covering pushing EUR close to recent highs against majors.  EUR bounce on the weaker than expected HICP flash print suggested two things: 1/ Market is getting short the euro ahead of the ECB and 2/ ECB may have to take action - e.g. strengthen its forward guidance, cut rates, suspend SMP sterilization - to stop euro from appreciating further Given 1/ and 2/, one can see why investors are squaring EUR-shorts. The ECB has the habit of disappointing those looking for policy easing and the memories from the last three meetings are still fresh. Given the risk of further short squeeze, it makes sense to be neutral going into the meeting. Investors could thus be tempted to buy the dips in the single currency in coming days. Lack of data disappointments - final PMI prints and German employment today - may help the euro as well.  The above also means that by the time of the ECB meeting, market positioning could be more neutral or even slightly long. This is also why we think that President Draghi could still surprise on the dovish side and trigger a (temporary) correction lower in EUR. Reasons for the ECB to be more dovish in April than in March/ Feb: 1/ Weaker than expected March HICP. Temporary factors may have played a role (e.g. early Easter boosting inflation in March 2013) and a payback in the form of stronger inflation print maybe due in April. That said, the March print goes against ECB’s expectations of low but stable inflation ahead. President Draghi could highlight that the downside risks to inflation have grown of late. 2/ Credit crunch remains a worry and sentiment indicators came off their recent highs in March in part because of recent weakness in Eurozone\u0027s main trading partners. It would be difficult for the Governing Council to argue that growth and credit outlook could improve significantly from here. What would constitute a dovish ECB-outcome: 1/ Clear indications that the inflation outlook has deteriorated in March and signals that it could deteriorate further from here especially if EUR-appreciation persists. Concerns about the lack of credit growth in the Eurozone and worry about the weaker global recovery. 2/ Measures that could include a 10-15bp refi rate cut, suspension of the SMP sterilization and/or FLS-type of program. The latter two could be perceived to signal that the ECB is willing to consider additional unconventional measures like QE and LTRO.  3/ Stronger forward guidance and indications that the council has discussed measures like QE or negative deposit rates at this meeting. Valentin Marinov Why AUD can’t sell-off post RBA AUD ticked lower as markets digested today’s RBA statement, but the move has struggled to extend. The statement itself erred on the dovish side since the Governor’s recent optimism on stronger growth as the handover from the mining boom continues apace was absent and there was a slight ramping up of rhetoric on the exchange rate. In the previous statement the RBA noted that, although the exchange rate remained high, its earlier depreciation would support growth. In today’s statement policymakers added the wrinkle that the boost to growth would be somewhat smaller given appreciation over the past several months. The lack of response to this somewhat more dovish outcome is likely a function of two factors. First, market positioning is still short so there is limited pain on the downside. Leveraged investors have begun to cover short positions over the past several weeks, but there likely remains a sizeable stock of shorts following the consistent selling in previous months. Second, the potency of RBA verbal intervention is lower since the threat of lower interest rates has been removed. There is little incentive for investors to treat jawboning on the exchange rate as anything other than a buying opportunity since authorities have made no moves to reduce the underlying attractiveness of AUD. Today’s price action suggests that market fatigue with RBA verbal intervention has grown. Todd Elmer Tankan a modest JPY negative The headline Tankan only slightly undershot expectations, which may go some ways to explaining the lack of a pronounced response from JPY. The DI for large manufactures improved to +17 from +16 in the previous report though it fell short of the economist expectation at +19. However, we read the details of the Tankan report as negative for JPY since they suggest firms anticipate weaker conditions after the sales tax hike. For instance, the large non-manufactures outlook for June came out at +13, suggesting the DI will deteriorate sharply over the next quarter. This tends to support the argument for more JPY-negative BoJ easing. While it remains the base case that easing will not come until June, the Tankan indicates a marginally higher risk of sooner easing. The outlook indices for June, for both large and small manufacturers, undercut expectations. In addition to being a negative sign on the expected sale tax impact, this could signal that external demand is expected to be weaker. The budget rate for USDJPY among the large manufactures was raised to 99.48 for FY2014, compared with the FY2013 rate of 96.78 in December. Japanese exporters have set the forward hedging ratio at an unusually low level over the past year and, consequently, have been under-hedged more recently. Given the new budget rate is closer to the spot, they will likely increase the forward hedge ratio toward a more normal level. So even without a significant improvement in exports, this could increase USD selling pressure, locking in a budget rate by increasing forward hedges. We expect USD to appreciate to 108 against JPY around July, although Japanese corporate flows are likely to act against this in the meantime. Osamu Takashima   Figure 1. USDJPY and Tankan (DI of Large Manufactures) Figure 2. Tankan - Large Non-manufactures Sources: BoJ, Bloomberg, Citi FX Sources: BoJ, Citi FX CitiFX Global Flows: JPY selling gains momentum, EUR oversold, Latam and CEEMEA reversal Full document see here: https://www.citivelocity.com/menu/FX_OV?CVFXWireID\u003d1445695 Global Overview Two G10 flows rise to the top of CitiFX Flows this week; selling EUR and selling JPY. Risk/reward favors buying USDJPY for medium term accounts - short term EUR selling is advanced and positioning is a risk into the ECB. In EM FX, risk taking is the strongest since November 2013 and all three regions are capturing positive inflows. This is especially important for CEEMEA and LatAm. Strongest G10 Directional Signals ·          EUR downside at risk ahead of ECB: The data calendar reflects significant risk with the Japanese Tankan, ECB, US ISM and NFP prints with clients positioning for strong US data and a dovish ECB. EUR selling is the strongest 4-week trend captured in the data, driven by almost equal amounts from hedge funds and real money accounts alike. Positioning implies investors have now fully priced in a dovish ECB – leaving the currency at risk of disappointment. At this point we only want to point out the risk and not take a contrarian view. An important signal is that no reversal is present in the weekly order flow to signal clients are beginning to change their minds. ·          Clients turning on Japan: End of the fiscal-year is JPY negative and clients are increasingly selling JPY. Recently, real money directional shifts have been more important for JPY weakness than hedge fund flows. One reason is real-money accounts tend to be structural buyers of JPY, and domestic accounts engaged in repatriation will appear in our real money client type. Both hedge funds and real money clients were net JPY buyers December through February. For the JPY selling seen the past 3 weeks, hedge funds have closed 35% of their position, real money 20%. The fact that hedge funds appear to be leading the charge, and real money following increases our conviction in additional downside. ·          Leveraged selling of GBP stalling: Hedge funds flows have not driven the recent GBP rally, rather they have used price action as a means to take profit. The fact that their flows are reversing is meaningful. On a weekly basis, the GBP buying was the strongest flow in the G10 last week (see our FX overview page). Positioning in GBP has been mixed recently, with hedge funds selling out of GBP longs and real money funds net GBP buyers since August. As the inflation outlook continues to fall for Europe, we expect interest rate differentials will continue to exert influence on capital flows. A long GBP position is again becoming a macro staple. Figure 3. EUR selling has increased significantly over the past 4 weeks Source: CitiFX   Figure 4. Real money clients returning to JPY selling Figure 5. Hedge fund GBP profit taking is stalling, EURGBP negative Source: CitiFX Source: CitiFX How much of a “strong USD” is already priced in?  Overall, investors face a heavy data filled week, but positions reflect low inspiration with the rise of AUD and recently EUR damaging portfolios.  We see four market themes driving allocations, both macro and market structure based. Two directional views likely gain momentum this week are USDJPY upside and EURGBP downside. The $bloc has all but broken links to the Asian cycle, but our NZDJPY view faces the largest risk from the Fonterra auction today.  Where is the risk? Data this week will focus on the US ISM, Non-farm payrolls, and Euro area retail sales and the ECB rates decision. Our outlook for each of these risks can be found in the Week Ahead (https://www.citivelocity.com/menu/FX_OV?CVFXWireID\u003d1443398). The strong USD/ US outperformance theme has gained a lot of momentum in the past week – US 5y rates are at their highest level since early January (Figure 6). This lends to the view that the risk to the US is not so much that it outperforms, but that it disappoints investors’ expectations. If rates are still the dominant driver of the USD – then the 5y, and 2y1y fwd, show a considerable amount is in the price. 4 separate themes are driving FX markets of late: 1. Macro trades are stuck on the USD and GBP, i.e. driven by growth \u0026 inflation expectations. Both currencies continue to present some of the best opportunities looking forward. The Citi Economic surprise series bottomed over Q1 in both currencies, recently turning higher (Figure 7). The highest beta impact on FX is at the inflection points in the series, so a base view is its arguing for a stronger GBP and USD. Figure 6. 5y rates at the top of the range – looking for a break through Source: CitiFX, Bloomberg 2. Inflation downtrends will be broken by services inflation. Labor markets in the US and the UK have shown some of the strongest improvement of late (Figure 8). Services inflation accounts for nearly 50% of inflation for developed markets and one of the biggest macro puzzles is why it has remained so soft in this recovery. Labor tightness is a key component. For the USD to outperform, and US rates to break their range, it is not so much headline NFP that we watch, but the Unemployment and hourly wage numbers to give a better measure of wage inflation. The latter is not really driven by weather, but so far the trend in 2013/14 has been favorable. Figure 7. Economic data turning in UK and US Figure 8. Labor improvements in US, UK slowly building inflation Source: CitiFX, Bloomberg Source: CitiFX, Bloomberg 3. Positioning in FX has become a less influential driver as the market micro-structure changes. The series below (Figures 9, 20) are the USD orderflow we publish in CitiFX Global flows. It is the most real time and expansive measure of the USD market we know. Note that the amplitude of the positions (size of the peaks and troughs) has been decreasing on trend to almost nothing in 2014. This implies investors are becoming less convicted in their views, and less willing to hold FX positions for longer. Without a fundamental change to sentiment – breaking a low vol environment will be difficult. Both the USD and GBP selling has been reversing of late, but the positions aren’t close to closed (For greater details please see the latest CitiFX Global Flows update).  This implies positioning wont stand in the way of greater client allocations to each currency this week. Taking into consideration the ECB and the Tankan Survey – we think there is still room for USDJPY upside and EURGBP downside (also see EURGBP – where to from here?). 4. Despite a weakening China, the $bloc appears to have all but broken ranks with the Asian cycle. The RBA meeting and milk auction in New Zealand are perhaps the two most important risks markets face. There was little data to change investors minds last week on the outlook for Australia, and Governor Stevens failure to mention the AUD during an upbeat assessment of the Australian outlook has led to a round of short covering. Our data implies hedge funds have closed only 35% of their net AUD shorts. Figure 9. USD flows – leveraged clients Figure 10. USD flows – real money accounts Source: CitiFX, Bloomberg Source: CitiFX, Bloomberg NZD is at a 2.5 year high. Fonterra’s milk price auction prices is a key indicator of the strength of the NZD we should expect going forward, with the next auction today (Tuesday). While the RBNZ is unlikely to signal a dovish stance any time soon, if dairy prices were to fall and a second auction weak, then market participants might begin to rethink the 100bp of hikes priced in by December. This event is perhaps the largest risk to the NZDJPY recommendation in the strategy portfolio on the week (https://www.citivelocity.com/menu/FX_OV?CVFXWireID\u003d1440331). Richard Cochinos European trip notes -- EUR bearishness, JPY complacency, Ukraine contained, China pessimism Have spent the last five business days in Europe – Paris, Milan, Frankfurt, Edinburgh, London – primarily non-leveraged clients. The key takeaway is euro bearishness, with positions reflecting this bearishness. There is a sense particularly on the Continent that the ECB is focused on the EUR, with lower than desired inflation as the driver of this concern. Investors are very clearly expecting some sort of non-conventional policy to be announced this week. There is some debate over whether a small rate cut would move markets because it would convey ECB determination to stimulate or backfire as a demonstration of ECB unwillingness to act outside the box. Most clients would see it as a disappointment unless there was a concrete commitment to something more accompanying. On the whole, there was skepticism that support for lending to SMEs could be done effectively, and more clients seemed to be looking at negative deposit rates than QE as the unconventional policy route. There was also some discussion as to whether even ECB unconventional measures would be effective in stimulating the economy, rather than just pleasing asset markets, but the consensus was that the ECB would signal that they are ready to take the leap.  In terms of client views, from most disappointing to most aggressive, I would put the following odds: ·       No policy move – 15% ·       No policy move, but very dovish comments – 25% ·       Small rate cut but accompanied by concrete indications of unconventional policies – 30% ·       Unconventional policy announced – 30% On balance, I think European clients are going into this meeting expecting some announcement to be made. Citi economists do not expect a policy move but see dovish comments (https://ir.citi.com/lEs%2B3Wr20569q6O4b7njIP18NjrGlAeTyg6uY9WdeYOSwqbPUVeLRQ%3D%3D) , so there is some room for disappointment here. Our colleagues see some of the recent CPI moves as distorted by the calendar. Although the ECB “will likely review the arguments in favor of additional monetary policy stimulus, we believe that a wait-and-see attitude will prevail for now.” For the EUR the question is whether Draghi can tantalize investors enough with dovish comments, without making a concrete commitment. Even were he to surprise with a small rate cut (a very minority view among forecasters), I suspect the effect would be temporary unless there was more promised. These views are more aggressive than what my colleague Valentin Marinov encountered in Canada/US, which were more neutral EUR (https://www.citivelocity.com/menu/FX_OV?CVFXWireID\u003d1444208). My sense is that European clients are more focused on the macro aspects of EUR and inflation/growth, while North American clients see EUR as a current account surplus zone with a strong convergence trade. More broadly there was a strong pro-USD view across the board, based on the recovery and the shift in the Fed stance. Most clients thought that the Fed had given a subtle signal that it was shifting off its ultra-bullish stance, but were looking for additional confirmation. The short JPY view was held strongly by a few clients but viewed as last week’s soup by more.  A couple of investors clearly held the short JPY view strongly, but many did not see what was going to change and what would surprise. The debate was whether the BoJ would give a strong signal soon that they were going to increase JGB buying, or stick to a more leisurely path of examining the data through the summer. MY conclusion is that there would be catch-up USDJPY buying by many investors who do not have significant positions, if USDJPY broke towards 103.50. Short-covering would be painful below 101. (This mixed view on JPY and relatively low positioning is similar to what Valentin encountered). GBP views were mixed on both the economy and monetary policy. There were pockets of skepticism that recent economic performance would persist and that the BoE would be tightening anytime soon, but there were pretty balance by views that the UK economy and policy stance did not require as much stimulus as was in place. The Ukraine crisis will fizzle down is the prevalent view. Few clients expect a Russian move into eastern Ukraine. That was seen as qualitatively different than absorbing the Crimea. There was some discussion as to whether sanctions were noisome enough to prevent further Russian moves, or whether they were just face saving measures for the west that would have no real bite. European trade with Russia was seen as a major barrier to western escalation of financial/economic moves. Investors were pessimistic on China, but were unwilling to translate the pessimism into short CAD or AUD. These positions were small and shrinking. Even with an additional dose of stimulus, the view was that Chinese growth was likely to struggle. There was some discussion on the nature of the stimulus, its likely size and effectiveness, with some clients arguing that the stimulus would be constrained by unwillingness to compromise ongoing structural reforms. The china pessimism did not translate into any big short AUD or CAD positions. A number of clients were playing with the idea that NZD might be approaching toppish levels. I don’t have the sense of any big shorts but if bad news were to come, there is some potential pockets of selling.

            "summary": "Q1 behind us, RBA and PMIs ahead · USD traded a bit heavy Monday thanks to quarter-end flow and Chairwoman Yellen. Speaking at a community reinvestment conference in Chicago, Yellen came off more dovish than most remember when discussing the need for low rates and the health of the jobs market. · One could argue that her choice of words was chosen for the forum as she gave no policy specifics; others could argue that she was trying to downplay her “considerable time” appearance. · Regional data also inspired some action for FX currencies but uniform fading of knee-jerk reactions broadly suggested that markets are on hold for events later this week. Reviewing: – EUR dismissed soft CPI data. Eurozone March CPI dropped further to 0.5%, the lowest point since November 2009, versus 0.6% expected and 0.7% in February. Core CPI also dipped to 0.8% from 1.0%, in-line with expectation. – CHF lost ground on a nasty KOF. The March KOF economic barometer came in at 1.99 versus 2.05 expected and 2.03 in February. – GBP mortgage approvals eased back to 70.3k from a six year high of 76.9k in February, undershooting the consensus forecasts of 75.3k. Money supply data releases at the same time show that M4 ex IOFCs 3m-annualised has grown 3.0% in February, compared to 1.5% expected and 1.6% in January. – NOK found support on retail sales, which improved 0.6% MoM in February, versus 0.3% expected and 0.1% in January. Credit indicator growth amounts to 5.8% YoY in February, compared to 5.6% expected and 5.7% prior. The better data follows Norges Bank upgrading the policy and inflation outlook at last week\u0027s meeting. – CAD-shorts were challenged by a stronger-than-expected GDP print. This rose by 0.5% versus 0.4% expected and included an improvement in average weekly earnings to 3.0%. – USD-bulls were mildly surprised by Chicago PMI, which fell from 59.8 to 55.9 in March. The dip was driven by a decline in the employment index from 59.3 to 50.0, raising the NFP alarms. · Not a lot can be said about EURUSD or USDJPY. Both pairs remained in ranges, with EURUSD peaking around 1.3810 on Yellen’s comments and USDJPY, peaking around 103.40, into Chicago PMI and Yellen. · Turnover was healthy, showing no bias in EURUSD but a 52% skew for selling USDJPY on broad interest. EURJPY was also quite active, with real money and some corporate interest leading a 52% bias to the downside. · More interesting, selling EUR and selling JPY rose to the top of CitiFX Flows this week. GBP and AUD were the most heavily bought G10 currencies. Click here for more. · Our NY trader reminds JPY will see the Tankan survey Tuesday at 19:30 EST/0:30 London time. Three items should be watched closely: the new Price forecast, the DI forecast and the importers FX target level. Click here for his views on each component. · Month-end demand seemed clear for AUDUSD and NZDUSD in NY. Spot reached highs near 0.9280 and 0.8685 respectively. · Tuesday brings the RBA rate decision.

Based upon the base case GDP levels in the original prospectus of the GDP warrants, growth for 2013 needs to be greater than 3.22% for a payment to be made in December 2014. A new base year complicates this calculation. Based on a potential interpretation of the prospectus, the threshold growth rate for 2013 may be as low as 1.3%, meaning a payment would be made this year. ",

We attribute this primarily to a 10% increase in domestic beer-flavored beverage shipments which drove a 32% rise in domestic alcohol sales, to JPY16.5bn. We understand shipments in March rose 20% YoY on a spike in demand ahead of the consumption tax hike. Super Dry Premium, launched in February, also contributed to earnings. One feature of the extraordinary demand was the popularity of the top brand, Super Dry, which we surmise saw March sales rise 27%, beating the industry-average 20% gain. We believe Q1 beer sales were above plan, and we expect H1 earnings to beat guidance for flat OP. ",

The feasibility study was based on the replacement of the current 8ktpd mill with a new 38ktpd mill. KCG continues with its prior plan to hold off on a construction decision until 2015 at the earliest and in the meantime will continue to look at other opportunities to optimize economics, de-risk the project and assess project financing options. If a positive decision is made in 2015, the expanded production could commence by 2018 with an estimated 12 year mine life.",
